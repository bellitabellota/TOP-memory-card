# Pokémon Memory

This React project is my implementation of TOP's [Memory Card Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/react-new-memory-card).

The aim was to apply the React concepts learned so far and get a first hands-on practice with React's useEffect Hook.

The images are fetched via the Poké API and Netifly was used as deployment provider.
